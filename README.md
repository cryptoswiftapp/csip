CriptoSwiftApp Standards Documents
============================

This repository contains two types of files:

* CSIPs: CriptoSwiftApp Improvement Proposals
* Standards documents: Draft standards for submission as RFCs (Request For Comments)

CSIP documents are copied to this repository in order to provide a static reference point
for modifications suitable for CriptoSwiftApp.

For any innovative work or significant divergence, documents should
be prepared for submission as standards track RFCs.
